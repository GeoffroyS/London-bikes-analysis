# London-bikes-analysis
Data exploration: TfL bikes usage in London

## Notes
Data is available [here](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/)

GitHub doesn't allow external JS to run, so you won't see any plot using Bokeh (and hence, its JavaScript API...) in the notebook. Not to worry though, because I'll put these here!
